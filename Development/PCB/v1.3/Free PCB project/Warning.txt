
The FreePCB project ez80p_v213 is out of date!
==============================================

The SD card connector was changed (to ALPS brand) and other small
modifications made but the project file was lost (thank you Tortoise SVN!)

The Gerber files in the subdir ARE up to date for PCB revision v1.3
