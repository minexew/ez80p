
Release versions of AMOEBA
---------------------------

V103 - Updated the PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse Interface logic.

V102 - Swapped Spare_IO1/IO2 pin functions. IO1 is now NMI, IO2 is unused (input)

v101 - First AMOEBA release, same as v91 pre-release
 

Pre-release versions
--------------------

017 - VGA16/256/ROM2.01 - no known problems. Last version before Audio added.

020 - Simple audio system added: Left channel outputs 1024 byte 8bit signed waveform
      from $f80000, right channel outputs 8 bit signed waveform from $f80400.
      
      
021 - Not a config, just creating new sound system (8 channel)

022 - Not a config, just converting original sound system to ez80p (4 channel)

030 - First version with new sound system (8 channel)

035 - Changed sound system to use small 8 byte buffer for each channel
      automatically filled at start of scanlines

036 - Added line_count_lsb to hw_flags port allowing audio reg writes
      at "safe" times.

036b - HW flags bit 6 changed: Now set after system has created a new 4-byte buffer.
       Cleared when CPU writes to (or attempts to read from) any audio register.

038 - Fixed: Period accumulator was not cleared when writing to period reg.
      Swapped left and right audio channels.


042 - Added control of KB and mouse clock / data
      (KB outputs also currently connected to JP2 and JP3, keyboard stopped working
       previously?????)
      Switched ports 7 and 8
      Re-arranged the port input multiplexing - now have spare inputs for future.

048 - Updated PS2 interface (now have FIFO buffers) Added mouse ps/2 interface.
      Changed PS/2 port assignments.
 
050 - Fixed bug in above (mouse buffer read still at port4.. changed to 6)

053 - First version with working sprite system

064 - Tilemap added, still work in progress

066 - Added wide border mode, corrected map count values

067 - Changed VRT flag to a latch, cleared by writing 1 to port 9

070 - Wait states added for VRAM_B, sprite below line 512 fixed

071 - Fixed noise on Channel 7 (releasing bus to early - on a 50mhz cycle)
      Audio mixer changed: 10bit DSM used for both channels.

073 - IRQ enable port is now a SET/RESET type register

074 - VRAM B is now readable by CPU

075 - Sprites have own palette
    - Sprite enable moved to bit 0 of Port 41
    - Port 42 0:1 selects between alternative palettes for background and sprites

078 - Combined tilemap and bitmap modules.
    - Added Start/Modulo/Step controls to bitmap mode (and subpixel bits)
    - Added datafetch widthcontrol to tilemap and bitmap modes.
    - Glitch in tilemap update to fix

081 - Glitched fixed
      Video registers reorganized.
      Port 40+ is now a video register.

082 - ROM 0.03 installed.

085 - Added pixel and line doubling - effect on sprites not sorted yet.
    - Added palette 0-3 select for sprites and background

087 - Sprite priority control (per sprite) added
    - Right  border position control added ("wide border" control removed)
    - Rearranged vreg bits
    - Sprites now ignore pixel/line doubling

088 - PS/2 Interrupts (previously using NMI) have been switched to IRQ
      on PB0 of EZ80. NMI now sourced from JP3.

089 - "JP2" and "JP3" renamed "Spare_IO1" and "Spare_IO2"
      Both spare IOs are now pulled up in constraints.
      "ez80_instrd" is no longer connected and has been removed.

090 - Updated to ROM 0.06

091 - Ext_RAM /CS is pulled low when MREQ is active and 080000-7FFFFF is addressed
