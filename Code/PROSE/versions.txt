Current version

      See docs for usage.

      Changed "?" command list (excludes < etc)

Previous
--------

02D - (11-07-2011) Tested entire (documented) opcode list for ez80 CPU.
      Fixed some rogue opcode translations in the D command.


02C - Added "D - disassemble" command (and "DZ - disassemble Z80" command)


02B - Added Environment variables (see kernal routines)
      Added SET command for enviroment variables
      Programs now update the ERROR environment variable on return to PROSE

    - Fixed the reported Stack Pointer value when NMI freezer button is pressed.
      (Was originally 6 bytes too low due to a CALL and a PUSH prior to its value
      being read)

02A - Fixed "kr_write_file" call. External calls cannot use IX to pass data
      to PROSE as it is used to compute the jump! Inputs are now HL: filename
      DE: location, BC: Length.

029 - Improved keyboard and mouse initialization code: Requires AMOEBA v03

027 - Intellimouse Scroll Wheel enabled. Mouse Kernal calls return a counter 0-255 in B,
      (value is adjusted by mouse delta in 4th byte of Intellimouse packets)

026 - Mouse driver updated:

      Allow MS Intellimouse style mice (scroll wheel) that use 4-byte packets (untested).

      If incompatible mouse is connected, an error is now reported.

      Mouse initialization now skips ACK wait, and instead waits for $AA "POST OK" response.

025 - Bugfix: Minimum PROSE version from program header did not work.

024 - "RX" command updated. When argument = ">" the file is copied to the current
      disk directory (and not loaded to RAM in its entirity. Warning: uses a 32KB
      buffer at top of OS) - Requires Serial Link V3.0+

023 - Kernal routine "kr_get_font_info" added

01F - Changed font system, default font now unpacked to VRAM and full 32-255 ASCII
      character codes available
    - Added "FONT" command

01E - VMODE command added (made display code more flexible to suit).
   
01D - Joystick port pins configured as inputs

01C - Fixed format in SD card routines, other odd and ends.

01B - Lots of changes: File system error codes, kernal calls fixed / registers swapped etc
      
01A - Updated for AMOEBA v81

016 - Updated mouse routines

015 - Added internal "Mouse" Command to activate mouse driver

014 - Upon cold start sets small stack pointer to $ffff (top of MBASE: page)
