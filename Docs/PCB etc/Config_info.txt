

JTAG config mode
----------------

Press and hold the reset button and switch the power on. Release the reset button
and the green LED will flash rapidly until the FPGA has been configured via the
JTAG pins. Note: The FPGA's JTAG port is always active, it is not actually
necessary to enter JTAG mode first, but this mode prevents configuration from
the EEPROM at power-up.


Manual config slot selection
----------------------------

Enter JTAG mode as described above. Whilst the green LED is flashing rapidly,
press and release the reset button again - the system enters slot selection mode.
The red LED now flashes 1 to 7 times to indicate the slot to be made active.
Press and release the reset button following the desired slot - the relevant
slot will be made active and the system will reconfigure from that slot.


Other LED codes
---------------

Green LED flashes slowly (about once per second) - this means the FPGA
did not accept the config file sent from the EEPROM. It will be necessary
to change the active slot to one containing a valid config file. (JTAG mode
can be entered by pressing the button at this point, the system doesn't need
to be powered off).


Green LED on steady: FPGA started up OK (write mode disabled). In this mode
pressing the button sends a reset pulse to the eZ80 (note: this does not
reconfigure the FPGA)


Red LED, with yellow pulse: Writing to EEPROM.
