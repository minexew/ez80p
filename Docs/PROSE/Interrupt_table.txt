
PROSE sets up the following interrupt vector table at the bottom
of memory, each location is proceded with a "C3" byte (JP instruction)

Note: PROSE fills in only the vectors for NMI and PORTB 0 interrupts,
the other locations are uninitialized, except for their preceding
JP instuctions).

As the ROM area $0-$7ff is paged out once the OS runs, these locations
can be freely accessed the user programs. 

Interrupt vectors are listed in order of priority.
