
How to update AMOEBA on the EZ80P:
==================================

Under PROSE, use the command: FPGACFG [command] (parameters)

EG: To list the current contents of the EEPROM slots, enter:

FPGACFG L


To write a new FPGA config to a slot enter:

FPGACFG W x filename

 where "x" is the slot you wish to overwrite and "filename" is the
 name of xilinx .bin file to be written (if no filename is supplied
 you are prompted to download the .bin file via the serial link).


Once a new config file has been written, you should test it before
making it the power-on default boot slot. To do so, enter:

FPGACFG C x

 where x is the relevent slot number.


If all is well, the slot can be made the default power-on boot config with:

FPGACFG B x

 where x is the relevent slot number.


Manually setting the boot slot
==============================

The power-on boot config slot can be selected manually with the following procedure:

Press and hold the reset button and switch on the EZ80P. Release the reset
button and the green LED will flash rapidly. Press and release the reset button
again - the system enters slot selection mode.  The red LED now flashes x number
of times to indicate the slot which is to be made active. Press and release the
reset button following indication of the desired slot - the relevant slot will
be made active and the system will reconfigure from that slot. 

JTAG mode
=========

A config file can be sent via the EZ80P's JTAG port (using appropriate
cable and software). Press and hold the reset button then switch on the EZ80P.
Release the reset button and the green LED will flash rapidly - commence the
JTAG configuration at this point.  Note: The FPGA's JTAG port is always active
so a config file can actually be sent at any time, however if the method described
is not used the eZ80 CPU will not be automatically reset until the reset button
is pressed after configuration completes.
