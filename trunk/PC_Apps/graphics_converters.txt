
Simple graphics convertors. These are Windows programs made with
the free version of Purebasic (www.purebasic.com). Purebasic is
available for other platforms -  source code is provided to aid
in the porting of these apps.


Source images for these utils must be 256 colour, uncompressed .bmp
files.


"bmp_to_raw chunky"
-------------------

The source image is simply scanned in its entirity from left to right,
top to bottom, a pixel at a time. Each pixel outputs one byte.



"bmp_to_8x8_tiles"
------------------

The source image is scanned in 8x8 blocks from left to right, top to bottom.
So tile block 0 starts at (0,0) block 1 at (8,0)  block 2 at (16,0) etc



"bmp_to_amoeba_sprites"
-----------------------

The source picture is scanned in 16 pixel-wide columns from top to
bottom, left to right. Each column scan can be terminated when all 16
pixels on a line match a certain value, this value is prompted for when
the program runs.



"bmp_to_prose_font"
-------------------

The picture is scanned in the same way as the 8x8 tile convertor
however, only the first byte of every tile row is written. The bytes
written are single bitplane representations of the 8 source pixels on a
row IE: Leftmost source pixel = bit 7, rightmost source pixel = bit 0
(any non-zero source pixel byte counts as a set bit)



About the palette data
-----------------------

The original 24 bit platte colours from the .bmp file are by default
scaled down to 12 bit, padded with 4 zero bits at 15:12 (0000:R4:G4:B4)
and saved as little endian words. You can also save the original
unscaled palette in 3 byte groups (Red, Green, Blue..) if you wish.
