

JTAG config mode
----------------

Press and hold the reset button then switch on the EZ80P. Release the reset button
and the green LED will flash rapidly until the FPGA has been configured via the
JTAG pins. Note: The FPGA's JTAG port is always active so a config file can
be sent at any time, however the eZ80 CPU will not be automatically reset unless
the reset button is pressed after JTAG transfer is complete.


Manual config slot selection
----------------------------

Press and hold the reset button then switch on the EZ80P. Release the reset
button and the green LED will flash rapidly. Press and release the reset button
again - the system enters slot selection mode. 

The red LED now flashes x number of times to indicate the slot which is to be
made active. Press and release the reset button following indication of the
desired slot - the relevant slot will be made active and the system will
reconfigure from that slot. 


Other LED codes
---------------

Green LED flashes slowly on power up (about once per second) - this means the
FPGA did not accept the config file sent from the EEPROM. It will be necessary
to change the active slot to one containing a valid config file. (JTAG mode
can be entered by pressing the reset button at this point, the system doesn't need
to be powered off).


Green LED on steady: FPGA started up OK (write mode disabled). In this mode
pressing the button sends a reset pulse to the eZ80 (note: this does not
reconfigure the FPGA)


Red LED, with yellow pulse: Writing to EEPROM.
