

JTAG config mode
----------------

Press and hold the reset button and switch the power on. Release the reset button
and the green LED will flash rapidly until the FPGA has been configured via the
JTAG pins. Note: The FPGA's JTAG port is always active so a config file can
be sent at any time, however the eZ80 CPU will not be automatically reset unless
the reset button is pressed after JTAG transfer is complete.


Manual config slot selection
----------------------------

Press and hold the reset button and switch the power on then release the reset
button (same as entering JTAG mode). Whilst the green LED is flashing rapidly,
press and release the reset button again - the system enters slot selection mode.
The red LED now flashes 1 to 7 times to indicate the slot to be made active.
Press and release the reset button following the desired slot - the relevant
slot will be made active and the system will reconfigure from that slot.


Other LED codes
---------------

Green LED flashes slowly on power up (about once per second) - this means the
FPGA did not accept the config file sent from the EEPROM. It will be necessary
to change the active slot to one containing a valid config file. (JTAG mode
can be entered by pressing the reset button at this point, the system doesn't need
to be powered off).


Green LED on steady: FPGA started up OK (write mode disabled). In this mode
pressing the button sends a reset pulse to the eZ80 (note: this does not
reconfigure the FPGA)


Red LED, with yellow pulse: Writing to EEPROM.
