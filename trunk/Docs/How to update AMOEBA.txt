
How to update AMOEBA on the EZ80P:
==================================

Under PROSE, use the command: FPGACFG [command] (parameters)

EG: To list the current contents of the EEPROM slots, enter:

FPGACFG L


To write a new config to a slot enter:

FPGACFH W x filename

 where "x" is the slot you wish to overwrite and "filename" is the
 name of xilinx .bin file to be written (if no filename is supplied
 you are prompted to download the .bin file via the serial link).


Once a new config file has been written, you should test it before
making it the power-on default boot slot. To do so, enter:

FPGACFG C x

 where x is the relevent slot number.


If all is well, the slot can be made the default power on slot with:

FPGACFG B x



The power-on boot slot can also be set manually with the following procedure:

Press and hold the reset button and switch on the EZ80P. Release the reset
button and the green LED will flash rapidly. Press and release the reset button
again - the system enters slot selection mode. 

The red LED now flashes x number of times to indicate the slot which is to be
made active. Press and release the reset button following indication of the
desired slot - the relevant slot will be made active and the system will
reconfigure from that slot.
