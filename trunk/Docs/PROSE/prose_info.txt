
PROSE (Phil's Rudimentary Operating System Experiment)
------------------------------------------------------


PROSE runs in ADL mode and can launch ADL or Z80 mode programs from the command line.
PROSE-executable programs must have the file extension ".ezp" and start with a file header
with the format:

 $00 - Z80 JR instruction to jump over header data
 $02 - ASCII "PRO" = PROSE executable program ID
 $05 - Desired Load location (24 bit) 
 $08 - If > 0, truncate load to n bytes
 $0B - If > 0, minimum PROSE version requird
 $0D - If > 0, minimum AMOEBA version required
 $0F - Z80 (0) or ADL mode (1) program.

Z80 mode programs should set the MBASE register upon start-up to bits 23:16 of the load
location.  The easiest way to handle all the above is to begin programs with the following
source:

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

amoeba_version_req	equ 0		; 0 = dont care, else minimum AMOEBA version req'd
prose_version_req	equ 0		; 0 = dont care, else minimum PROSE version req'd
ADL_mode		equ 1		; 0 = user program is Z80 mode type, 1 if not
load_location		equ 10000h	; anywhere in system ram ($10000 upwards suggested)

			include	'PROSE_header.asm'

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Small Stack Pointer for Z80 programs is set to $FFFF by default PROSE starts (and so
the stack will be at the top of whatever 64KB page is being used for that program) but
it can be set at will by the user program.

The Large Stack Pointer (for ADL programs) is set the top of the top of system memory when
PROSE starts.

Remember to set the includes directory in your ZDS II project.



Calling PROSE kernal routines:
------------------------------

Load the accumulator with the routine label (see kernal_routines.txt for descriptions)
and set the other registers as appropriate for the routine in question. Then do an ADL
mode call to "prose_kernal"

EG: To print a line of text:

	ld hl,message_txt			; ADL mode program
	ld a,kr_print_string			; desired kernal routine
	call.lil prose_kernal			; call PROSE routine

This applies to both Z80 mode and ADL mode programs. (When a Z80 mode program
calls the PROSE kernal, registers used as location pointers have their MSB [23:16] 
set (by the kernal) to the MBASE register).


Exiting back to PROSE:
----------------------

Programs should return to PROSE with the instruction:

JP.LIL prose_return


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PROSE Internal Commands: 
------------------------

Change the look/settings of PROSE:
----------------------------------

VMODE   x     		- Set video resolution 0-3 (320x240 to 640x480)
FONT    x.fnt 		- Change font (see "fonts" folder)
KEYMAP  x.bin 		- Change from default UK keymap (see "keymaps" folder)
PEN     xy z  		- Change character attributes (x=background,y=foreground z = window colour)
PALETTE abc,def.. 	- Set the colour palette (up to 16 $0RGB values) 
CLS			- Clear screen

(The default video mode used by PROSE is 16 colour mode bitmap, 640x480)



LOAD / SAVE (SD card)
---------------------

LB filename address		- load raw data bytes to memory
SB filename address length      - save raw data bytes from memory to SD card
CD foldername			- change directory (if no folder name, show path)
VOLx:				- change volume (for partitioned cards)
DEL filename			- delete file
MD  foldername			- make directory
RD  foldername			- remove (empty) folder
RN filename1 filename2		- rename file
DIR				- show directory 
FORMAT				- FAT16 format an SD card
MOUNT				- Rescan for drives (EG: if swapped SD card)



Serial Comms:
-------------

RX filename address		- receive file from PC over serial link and place in memory.

 Notes:  If filename is "*"  any file will be accepted. 

   If filename is "!" the file will be treated as an executable, loaded to the
   address in the file header and immediately run.

   If the filename is ">" the file will be written to the SD card (not loaded to memory)

TX filename address length 	- send a file to the PC over serial link.



Debug:
------

C  address1 address2 address3	- Copy bytes from address1->address2 to address3
D  [address*]			- Disassemble a page of ADL-code #
DZ [address*]			- Disassemble a page of Z80-mode code #
:  address ab,cd.. 		- Place bytes at address
F  address1 address2 x		- Fill memory with x from address1 to address2
H  address1 address2 ab,cd	- Hunt in memory for bytes from address1 to address2
M  [address*]			- Show memory as hex bytes 
T  [address*]			- Show memory as ascii (if no address continue from previous)
R 				- Show registers (as upon exit of last program / NMI freeze)

Notes: 

* If [address] is omitted, the operation continues from the last location used by
  the command)

# The only difference between the D and DZ is that DZ disassembles with the assumption
  that all address references and immediate data words are 16 bit as per the original
  Z80 CPU (and not 24 as per the EZ80).



Misc:
-----

MOUSE				- Enable mouse driver
EXEC filename			- Run a script *
SET varname=string		- Set an environment variable 


Notes:

* Scripts (IE: batch files) cannot run other scripts.

  Scripts can be aborted by holding CRTL+C.

  PROSE will run a script named "STARTUP.SCR" (if it exists in the root dir) when it starts

  Scripts support basic looping features using the syntax:

   IF environment_variable = ascii_string LABEL
   or
   IF environment_variable <> ascii string LABEL
  
   IE: If an environment variable has been initialized and its contents match (or
      do not match) the ascii_string specified, then jump to LABEL.

   Lables are defined in square brackets at the start of lines (no other characters
   should follow a label).

   END will stop a script at that line.

   An example Script:

   VERS
   [DO_THIS]
   pen 37
   VERS
   PEN 26
   VERS
   IF my_envar = string_a DO_THIS
   IF my_envar = string_b DO_THAT
   PEN 7
   MOUSE
   END
   [DO_THAT]
   PEN 6
   MOUNT
 
   (The environment variable name, value and label strings are currently limited to a
    maximum of 16 characters)
