PROTED - A text editor for PROSE ported by Enzo Calogiuri
---------------------------------------------------------

The use of the editor is very simple. To start it you can do:

proted <return>: the edited text is saved in the file "noname.txt"
proted myfile.ext <return>: if the file exists, is loaded into memory,
otherwise the text typed will be saved as myfile.ext

These commands are usable in the program:

Ctrl + L: insert a line.
Ctrl + K: delete a line.
Ctrl + E: end of text.
Ctrl + T: top of file.
Ctrl + N: redraw screen.
Ctrl + B: break a line.
Ctrl + R: reload file.
Ctrl + S: save file.
Ctrl + Q: quit to PROSE.

Also this keys are active: Tab, Cursor Keys, PgUp, PgDown, Home, End, Del.

Note that Return key does not create or divide a new line, simply is Carriage Return.
To divide a line into two you must use Ctrl + B and Ctrl + L to insert a new blank line.
