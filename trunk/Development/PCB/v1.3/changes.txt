Changes from v1.1
-----------------

Soft power system replaced by more straightforward low current latching
push button switch and MOSFET.

Fixed misrouted connections between FT232RL and Ez80 (and altered
power connections to FT232RL)

3M SD card connector (obsolete?) replaced with ALPs brand 

Minor changes such as JTAG resistors now use a resistor net,
separate resistors for status LEDs, position of external
SD card LED jumper moved.
