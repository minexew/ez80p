
Current version
---------------

27-8-2011

038		: Kernal call "kr_set_pointer" initialize / display the mouse pointer
	        : (512 bytes at top of VRAM B reserved for OS pointer sprite)
	
		: Entering "G 0" enables the ROM for reset (was hanging due to vector table
                ; overwriting the RAM copy of ROM)

		: Added support routines for relocatable code
		
		: Added memory allocation feature: "kr_allocate_memory", "kr_deallocate_memory"

		: Added AVAIL command for memory info
		
		: Added "kr_get_mem_top" (and renamed "kr_get_os_high" to "kr_get_mem_base")

                : Command line loading of EZP programs, RX and LB commands check for protected
                  areas of RAM and prompt the user to confirm the operation if these would be overwritten.

		: Added: Return values to envars: New PROSE standard - commands can pass 24bit values to envars on exit
		  starting at "OUT00", then "OUT01" etc.  AVAIL and VERS do this when they have the argument "#"

                ; Added FI [filename] (file info) command, additional # argument is accepted.

                ; Fixed PROSE error reports for filesystem errors $cc and $cd

                ; DIR and format show capacity in MB (or KB if less than 1MB)
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous versions:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


037		: File loads faster (when more than 4 bytes at a time are loaded)

                : Program return codes slightly changed, if A = 0: All OK, If A = 1
                  driver error (driver error code in B), FF/FE are the same. Zero flag
                  no longer important.

                : kr_set_timeout and kr_test_timeout added

                : Error messages shown on new line on return to PROSE

		: Interrupt vector table set up in page 0 for all eZ80 IRQs.



036          :  Bugfix: New SD card driver was relying on previous ROM-based driver code
                to initialize the card (a 4ms time delay was missing from the new init code)


035 - Update :  New SD card driver. Now supports SDHC, faster reads.
		From this release, drivers should return with the Zero Flag set if all OK.
		
	New  :  "kr_get_disk_sector_ptr" - returns location of the prose sector pointer (in HL)
                 and the location of the sector buffer in DE.



034 - Bugfix : When a card was formatted without a label, garbage would be displayed
               when using MOUNT or DIR commands. This has now been fixed.

	New  : "Home" and "End" keys reposition cursor on OS screen.


033 - Changed: Disables sprites upon restart or when "kr_OS_display" is called
               Changed NMI handler for AMOEBA v107
               "PEN" command will now accept palette data (3rd parameter onwards)
               
		REQUIRES AMOEBA v107



032 - Changed: Pushes and Pops IX and IY around kernal calls. No kernal calls now use
               IX or IY to pass data.

		"kr_file_sector_list"		- now passes data out in BC instead of IX
		"kr_serial_receive_header"	- now passes data out in DE instead of IX
		"kr_serial_send_file"		- now set xDE = source address, xBC = length 



031 - Changed: Font rendering. Uses new character map mode (much faster) Requires AMOEBA v106

      Removed: Variable font size support code.
               Kernal routine: "kr_get_font_parameters" - obsolete.

      Added:   kernal routine: "kr_set_video_mode" 
               kernal routine: "kr_set_cursor_image"
               kernal routine: "kr_remove_cursor"
	       kernal routine: "kr_char_to_font" - for user defined graphics

      Renamed: kernal routine: "kr_get_display_size" to "kr_get_video_mode", 
               now returns video mode in A (B = width, C = height as before)

      Added:   Checks AMOEBA version on start-up, shows message if not the required version.
     
      Changed: PROSE fonts are now the full 256 character set (256x8 bytes)
               Cursor handling is handled via character swap (def modification)


030 - Added:  Kernal routine: "kr_play_audio" - sets audio channel(s) playing.
              kernal routine: "kr_disable_audio" - silences all channels.
              kernal routine: "kr_get_joysticks" - provides convenient joystick reading. 

02f - Changed: kernal keyboard routines now return ASCII codes (0-31) for keys when
               CTRL is held (lower-case ASCII code of the key - 96). Note if these
               characters are displayed, they will show up as garbage so user programs
               should check for them.

      Fixed:   kr_get_display_size (wasn't returning correct figures)

      Changed: kr_get_string now null-terminates the ascii string


02e - Fixed "EXEC" command and added basic jump features (IF <condition> LABEL), END.
      See docs for usage.

      Changed "?" command list (excludes < etc)

02D - (11-07-2011) Tested entire (documented) opcode list for ez80 CPU.
      Fixed some rogue opcode translations in the D command.


02C - Added "D - disassemble" command (and "DZ - disassemble Z80" command)


02B - Added Environment variables (see kernal routines)
      Added SET command for enviroment variables
      Programs now update the ERROR environment variable on return to PROSE

    - Fixed the reported Stack Pointer value when NMI freezer button is pressed.
      (Was originally 6 bytes too low due to a CALL and a PUSH prior to its value
      being read)

02A - Fixed "kr_write_file" call. External calls cannot use IX to pass data
      to PROSE as it is used to compute the jump! Inputs are now HL: filename
      DE: location, BC: Length.

029 - Improved keyboard and mouse initialization code: Requires AMOEBA v03

027 - Intellimouse Scroll Wheel enabled. Mouse Kernal calls return a counter 0-255 in B,
      (value is adjusted by mouse delta in 4th byte of Intellimouse packets)

026 - Mouse driver updated:

      Allow MS Intellimouse style mice (scroll wheel) that use 4-byte packets (untested).

      If incompatible mouse is connected, an error is now reported.

      Mouse initialization now skips ACK wait, and instead waits for $AA "POST OK" response.

025 - Bugfix: Minimum PROSE version from program header did not work.

024 - "RX" command updated. When argument = ">" the file is copied to the current
      disk directory (and not loaded to RAM in its entirity. Warning: uses a 32KB
      buffer at top of OS) - Requires Serial Link V3.0+

023 - Kernal routine "kr_get_font_info" added

01F - Changed font system, default font now unpacked to VRAM and full 32-255 ASCII
      character codes available
    - Added "FONT" command

01E - VMODE command added (made display code more flexible to suit).
   
01D - Joystick port pins configured as inputs

01C - Fixed format in SD card routines, other odd and ends.

01B - Lots of changes: File system error codes, kernal calls fixed / registers swapped etc
      
01A - Updated for AMOEBA v81

016 - Updated mouse routines

015 - Added internal "Mouse" Command to activate mouse driver

014 - Upon cold start sets small stack pointer to $ffff (top of MBASE: page)
